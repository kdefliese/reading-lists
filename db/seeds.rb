  {book_id: 2, body: "Whose eye? Why, the eye of the world, of course! Sit back and enjoy the ride. It will make you laugh. It will make you weep. It will make you think about your humanity and the humanity of those around you.", reviewer:"John H.P."},

  {book_id: 4, body: "My daughter won't put this book down. She reads it during school. She reads it all night. She won't talk to anyone. Apparently it's a great book, but it's tearing our family apart.", reviewer:"Samantha P."},

  {book_id: 11, body: "A book about kids waging war? That's messed up. And that's what makes this book so compelling. Also, if you like video games, there are parts that are very video-gamey. Recommend.", reviewer:"Hannah P.G."},
  {book_id: 13, body: "I've read many other books by this author, so I expected to be blown away by this one. What a let down. Characters are one dimensional. The protagonist is a callow lunatic. Do not recommend.", reviewer:"P.J. Merriweather"},
  {book_id: 13, body: "This book transformed the way I look at fiction. Please don't listen to the critics- it deserves a deep read.", reviewer:"M.J. Madden"}
